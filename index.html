    <h3>A little bit about myself!</h3>

    <p>My name is Celina Kim and I am a rising junior at Cornell University. <br/> <br/>

      I was born in South Korea but moved to America when I was seven years old. Currently, I live in NYC with my parents 
      and my brother who is eight years younger than me! <br/> <br/>

      I was initially a chemistry major but after a traumatizing battle with general chemistry my freshmen year, 
      I quickly realized that chemistry was not for me. Now I am an Information Science major with concentration
      in interactive technologies and UI/UX! <br/> <br/>


      <em>Fun fact: I am incredibly TERRIFIED of pigeons after getting hit by one when I was in the fourth grade.
      That being said, living in NYC is rough at times when I am forced to face a troop of pigeons every single day.</em>
